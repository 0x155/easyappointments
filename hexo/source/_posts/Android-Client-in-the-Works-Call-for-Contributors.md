With the release of Easy!Appointments v1.2 a flexible REST API became available for the clients. Developers can now create rich content clients and modify that can manage any aspect of the application. 

Matteo Venturi, a developer based in Italy has started a new project for the implementation of an Android client that will enhance the user experience of Easy!Appointments for mobile devices. More than that the project will also be open sourced and therefore free as in freedom. 

As there's still much work to be done we kindly ask developers and any other kind of experts to help with the implementation of the client. 

Feel free to contact directly [alextselegidis@gmail.com](mailto:alextselegidis@gmail.com) for further information. 
 
Fork and star the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alextselegidis/easyappointments-android-client).
