Here are some key features of the API: 

- it uses basic authorization schema for client
- follows the REST pattern with clear resource structures and correct HTTP verbs and status codes

- it can manipulate all the possible data of the application

and this is only the start! More features will be coming with the future releases such as token based authentication, pagination headers, sub-resources, resource linking and custom filtering.
