One of the key features of the upcoming v1.2 release is the redesign of the backend which will now be responsive and also includes some optical enhancements.  

Bringing responsiveness to backend was a feature that many users requested and will make the use of the Easy!Appointments a lot easier for mobile devices.  

Try the new backend by [installing the Alpha package of Easy!Appointments v1.2](https://github.com/alextselegidis/easyappointments/releases/download/1.2.0-alpha.1/easyappointments_1.2.0_alpha.1.zip).
