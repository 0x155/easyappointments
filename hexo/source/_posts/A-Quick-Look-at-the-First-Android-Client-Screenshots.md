Some days ago we [announced the creation of a new Android client](/blog/2017/05/17/Android-Client-in-the-Works-Call-for-Contributors/) and we already have the first screenshots, thanks to the great work of [Matteo](https://github.com/matteoventuri7). 

<div style="float:left; width:45%; padding:10px; margin-bottom:30px"> 
    ![](easyappointments-android-client-01.png)
    
    *Use your admin's credentials for signing in to the app.*
</div>
 
<div style="float:left; width:45%; padding:10px; margin-bottom:30px"> 
    ![](easyappointments-android-client-02.png)
    
    *Data handling is pretty straight forward.*
</div>

<div style="width:45%; padding: 10px;">
    ![](easyappointments-android-client-03.png)
    
    *This is a native Android implementation that will provide a smooth scheduling experience.*
</div>

As part of this collaborative effort the REST API of Easy!Appointments will introduce a new functionality starting from release v1.3. Resource aggregations will allow API clients to fetch more information about the requested resources by avoiding the execution of unnecessary requests.
