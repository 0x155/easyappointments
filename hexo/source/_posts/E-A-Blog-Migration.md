After many years of using the WordPress blogging platform the blog of Easy!Appointments has finally moved to 
GitHub Pages and now is a part of the official website. This practically means that you will not have to leave 
the website to read its contents. 

The new blog theme is also responsive and will be gradually improved in order to match the original website experience.
Old posts can be read from the old blog address at http://easyappointments.wordpress.com. At this point it is 
important to give credits to [Hexo](https://hexo.io), a fast, simple & powerful blogging tool which now powers this site.

You are more than welcome to provide feedback with suggestions or issues that you may find on this blog. 

Happy Bookin'
