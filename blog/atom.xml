<p>Some days ago we <a href="/blog/2017/05/17/Android-Client-in-the-Works-Call-for-Contributors/">announced the creation of a new Android client</a> and we already have the first screenshots, thanks to the great work of <a href="https://github.com/matteoventuri7" target="_blank" rel="external">Matteo</a>. </p>
<div style="float:left; width:45%; padding:10px; margin-bottom:30px"><br>    <img src="easyappointments-android-client-01.png" alt=""><br><br>    <em>Use your admin’s credentials for signing in to the app.</em><br></div>

<div style="float:left; width:45%; padding:10px; margin-bottom:30px"><br>    <img src="easyappointments-android-client-02.png" alt=""><br><br>    <em>Data handling is pretty straightforward.</em><br></div>

<div style="width:45%; padding: 10px;"><br>    <img src="easyappointments-android-client-03.png" alt=""><br><br>    <em>This is a native Android implementation that will provide a smooth scheduling experience.</em><br></div>

<p>As part of this collaborative effort the REST API of Easy!Appointments will introduce a new functionality starting from release v1.3. Resource aggregations will allow API clients to fetch more information about the requested resources by avoiding the execution of unnecessary requests. </p>
<p>Contributors are more than welcome and can contact <a href="mailto:alextselegidis@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="external">alextselegidis@gmail.com</a> (REST API) or <a href="mailto:matteo.venturi7@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="external">matteo.venturi7@gmail.com</a> (Android Client) for further information. </p>
