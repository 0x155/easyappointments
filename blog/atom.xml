    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the release of Easy!Appointments v1.3.2 the minimum MySQL version requirement was changed to v5.7. The reason under this change is that upcoming Easy!Appointments releases will take advantage of newer MySQL features and allow developers handle data more easily. </p>
<p>Moreover MySQL 5.5 has already reached its end of life and users are advised to use a newer version. More information on upgrading to a newer version can be found in the official MySQL site at <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/upgrading.html" target="_blank" rel="external">https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/upgrading.html</a>. </p>
<p>Moving to MySQL v8.0 users will find plenty of new features such as MySQL Document Store, Transactional Data Dictionary, SQL Roles, Default to utf8mb4, Common Table Expressions, Window Functions and much more. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are more than happy to announce that Easy!Appointments version 1.3.0 has finally made it to a stable release and brings many new features and improvements to the platform. Here are some of the most notable changes of this release.</p>
<h3 id="Availabilities-Generation-Enhancements-for-more-Flexible-Reservations"><a href="#Availabilities-Generation-Enhancements-for-more-Flexible-Reservations" class="headerlink" title="Availabilities Generation Enhancements for more Flexible Reservations"></a>Availabilities Generation Enhancements for more Flexible Reservations</h3><p>Multiple attendants and flexible time intervals introduce further complexity into any booking system. Easy!Appointments can now handle more complex use cases when it comes to multiple attendants for the same time slots. Take advantage of the flexible scheduling engine!</p>
<h3 id="ICS-File-Integration"><a href="#ICS-File-Integration" class="headerlink" title="ICS File Integration"></a>ICS File Integration</h3><p>Appointment notifications will now contain an ICS file attachment that can be used with to import the event information into external calendars. Many office suites will parse these files automatically and propose event actions right in place. </p>
<h3 id="Arabic-Translation"><a href="#Arabic-Translation" class="headerlink" title="Arabic Translation"></a>Arabic Translation</h3><p>Thanks to Rashed Altamimi and Abdulhamid Ghannam Easy!Appointments is now translated into Arabic (although RTL support will come with a future release). Keep contributing to the project with more translations and localization details and help Easy!Appointments become more flexible and easy to use. </p>
<h3 id="Major-FullCalendar-Widget-Update"><a href="#Major-FullCalendar-Widget-Update" class="headerlink" title="Major FullCalendar Widget Update"></a>Major FullCalendar Widget Update</h3><p>Easy!Appointments will now use FullCalendar 3 packages for the calendar page which provide better user experience, better event handling and more stable execution. Moreover, new settings became available with the update and future releases will strive on taking full advantage of them.</p>
<h3 id="Docker-Support-for-both-Development-and-Production-Environments"><a href="#Docker-Support-for-both-Development-and-Production-Environments" class="headerlink" title="Docker Support for both Development and Production Environments"></a>Docker Support for both Development and Production Environments</h3><p>Docker has become one of the most popular development tools and that for a good reason. Easy!Appointments has now an official Docker configuration that can be either used for development or production environments. Docker will help you setup Easy!Appointments without ever needing to install Apache/Ningx, PHP or MySQL manually. A more detailed tutorial will become available soon. </p>
<h3 id="Codebase-Improvements"><a href="#Codebase-Improvements" class="headerlink" title="Codebase Improvements"></a>Codebase Improvements</h3><p>As with every new release the codebase received a big variety of improvements which aim to make new feature development, debugging and customizing easier so that developers become more productive when working with Easy!Appointments. </p>
<h3 id="Other-Improvements"><a href="#Other-Improvements" class="headerlink" title="Other Improvements"></a>Other Improvements</h3><p>Thanks to your wonderful support many reported issues were addressed and made it to the final release, something that makes the platform more stable and secure.</p>
<p>The update procedure has now a simple UI that will inform the user of the update outcome and provide more technical details for easier debugging. </p>
<p>Once the debug mode is on the app will provider more technical information for better troubleshooting and support.</p>
<p>Cache busting mechanism will ensure that older clients will receive the new asset files when browsing Easy!Appointments. </p>

<p>Although the installation of Easy!Appointments is a very trivial task for web developers, beginners and non technical users will have hard times setting this up as every web application requires an HTTP server and database service installed. </p>
<p>Having a local testing &amp; evaluation environment is really important in order to be able to perform tasks that will not affect production data. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="android-client-screenshots.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Some days ago we <a href="/blog/2017/05/17/Android-Client-in-the-Works-Call-for-Contributors/">announced the creation of a new Android client</a> and we already have the first screenshots, thanks to the great work of <a href="https://github.com/matteoventuri7" target="_blank" rel="external">Matteo</a>. </p>
<div style="float:left; width:45%; padding:10px; margin-bottom:30px"><br>    <img src="easyappointments-android-client-01.png" alt=""><br><br>    <em>Use your admin’s credentials for signing in to the app.</em><br></div>

<div style="float:left; width:45%; padding:10px; margin-bottom:30px"><br>    <img src="easyappointments-android-client-02.png" alt=""><br><br>    <em>Data handling is pretty straightforward.</em><br></div>

<div style="width:45%; padding: 10px;"><br>    <img src="easyappointments-android-client-03.png" alt=""><br><br>    <em>This is a native Android implementation that will provide a smooth scheduling experience.</em><br></div>

<p>As part of this collaborative effort the REST API of Easy!Appointments will introduce a new functionality starting from release v1.3. Resource aggregations will allow API clients to fetch more information about the requested resources by avoiding the execution of unnecessary requests. </p>
<p>Contributors are more than welcome and can contact <a href="mailto:alextselegidis@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="external">alextselegidis@gmail.com</a> (REST API) or <a href="mailto:matteo.venturi7@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="external">matteo.venturi7@gmail.com</a> (Android Client) for further information. </p>

<p><strong>Important Notice: With the update of CodeIgniter to v3.1.4 the minimum requirement for PHP is v5.6 so make sure that your server is up to date before updating your installation.</strong> </p>
<p>The reason of this minimum requirements change is that PHP releases prior to v5.6 are not supported any more and may lead to severe security vulnerabilities. </p>
